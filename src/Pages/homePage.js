  //To make it simple, the debounce consists of a local variable in this case debounceID on line 7.
  //This is to prevent it from creating several copies of the variable. Check JS pointers and references on google.
  //And in the debounce helper function it checks if the debounceID isn't null/already has an instance running and stop the instance
  //Then creates a new instance. In simplicity it keeps on instance running all the time when something is searched in the field.
  //This in turn also keeps the fetch from backend in one instance instead of creating several fetches at same time.
  //NOTE: A debounce is used widely in almost every project to reduce load on frontend and increase performance in the app overall.
